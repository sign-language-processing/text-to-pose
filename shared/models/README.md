# Pose Encoder

## Current Implementation

Given the pose data, sequence mask, and optionally additional sequence, 
this model uses a transformer to encode the sequences.
It has a limited length (marked with `max_seq_size`) given that it relies on learned positional embeddings.

It might not be the best we can do.

## New Implementation: Graph (TODO)
We can use https://www.pyg.org/ to encode the pose data as a graph,
making edge indexes between the limbs within a frame, and joints between frames.

## New Implementation: Visual (TODO)

Naturally, a pose is visual. It has spatiotemporal information, with a strong bias towards neighboring frames.
Therefore, we should use a CNN to encode the pose.

Using the `FastAndUglyPoseVisualizer`, we can visualize each of the pose's components independently as an `Nx64x64` monochrome video.

The rationale behind having each component as a separate video is that we want to cover as much as the video as possible, and avoid white space.
To generate a video with hands and face clearly visible, we would need very high video resolution.

While we can treat this as a `Nx64x64x4` tensor, it doesn't really makes sense to perform 4D convolutions.
Instead, we can use a 3D CNN (`Nx64x64`), with multiple layers, 
to "compress" the `64x64` frames to a `256` dimensional vector, for example, 
and finally convolve over the `Nx256x4` tensor, or concatenate to `Nx1024` vectors, and encode them with a transformer.

### Possible advantages
1. Better encoding of spatiotemporal information
2. Probably fewer parameters
3. No limit on sequence length

### Possible disadvantages
1. Drawing poses is slow-ish (we can do 70000 frames per second)

### Pose-to-Video usage
We could try to diffuse between the representations learned by this model,
and a VAE representations to generate videos.
We will have three models: 1. the pose encoder; 2. the diffuser; 3. the VAE.
